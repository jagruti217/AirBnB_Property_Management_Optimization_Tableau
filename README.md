# AirBnB Property Management Optimization through Tableau

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings aimed at optimizing rental strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue for property owners. The project leverages Airbnbâ€™s dataset to provide insights on pricing, demand trends, and customer preferences, with results visualized through a Tableau dashboard for actionable decision-making.

## Problem Statement
As a Data Analyst at Airbnb, the objective of this project is to generate valuable insights from Airbnb's dataset, helping both Airbnb and property hosts improve decision-making through optimized rental strategies, enhanced customer satisfaction, and increased host revenue.

## Analysis Goals

Prepare Tableau Calculations and Analysis for the Following:
1. **Neighborhood Popularity and Pricing**: Identify high-demand areas and analyze how pricing varies across different locations.
2. **Property Type Distribution**: Examine the demand for various property types (e.g., entire homes, private rooms).
3. **Customer Satisfaction and Ratings**: Analyze the relationship between listing prices and review ratings to uncover factors driving customer satisfaction.
4. **Seasonality and Booking Trends**: Track booking trends throughout the year to identify seasonal demand patterns.
5. **Host and Listing Analysis**: Determine which hosts have the most listings and compare their pricing strategies.
